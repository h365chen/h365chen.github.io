I have created a nice little video for describing high-level overview of the approach.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-center">
        {%
            include video.liquid
            path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nddmCmp1Bng"
            title="Using DFS to Find Articulation Points and Biconnected Components"
            class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"
        %}
    </div>
</div>
